# MIT-Operating-System-6S081

Recently I am taking the well-known MIT OS course,and the labs are interesting .I am also reading "OS:design and implementation "this days ,so there will be notes about OS and my own code implementing these labs (To be honst, it's really a little hard for me.However ,call it the beginning of changing my major!)
